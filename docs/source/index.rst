Perseus Image Plug-in Documentation
===================================

**Perseus** is a freely available data analysis program that now can analyse also fMRI images. Operative systems currently supported: Windows and Linux

Perseus was developed in `CoxLab <https://www.biochem.mpg.de/cox>`_. To download and know more about it go to this `link <https://maxquant.net/perseus/>`_.

Manual
------

In this guide you will find a complete description of how the program works and how to use it. In Perseus you can run a complete analysis of fMRI data, from preprocessing to multi-subjects analyses, easily visualize your data and share your workflow. Check the sections below to know more about the mathematics behind each command or to choose the parameters that suit the most yuor dataset.

**IMPORTANT**

Preprocessing uses SPM, so it is needed to have installed in your computer both SPM and MatLab. Check `SPM webpage <https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/>`_ or alternatively `SPM WikiBook <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/Installation_on_Windows>`_ to know how to install it. If you prefer to use another software to preprocess your data, you then can just upload the output files and use Perseus only for statistical analyses. To do so no other third parties software are needed.
